Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is an image processing technology that uses a number plate to identify a vehicle. The aim is to design an efficient automatic authorized vehicle identification system using the vehicle registration plate. The developed system first detects the video and then captures the image. The vehicle number plate region is extracted using image segmentation in an image. The optical character recognition technique is used to recognize the characters. From the experiment, it is observed that the developed system successfully detects and recognizes vehicle number plates on real images. Automatic vehicle Number plate detection and recognition is a key technique in most of applications such as like military zones or area around top government offices e.g.Parliament, Supreme Court etc and is an active research topic in the image processing domain.
